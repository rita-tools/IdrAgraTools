1;Low runoff potential;The soils have a high infiltration rate even thoroughly wetted. They chiefly consist of deep well drained to excessively drained sands or gravels. They have a high rate of water transmission.
2;Moderately low runoff potential;The soils have a moderate infiltration rate when thoroughly wetted. They chiefly are moderately deep to deep, moderately well-drained to well-drained soils that have moderately fine to moderately coarse textures. They have a moderate rate of water transmission.
3;Moderately high runoff potential;The soils have a slow infiltration rate when thoroughly wetted. They chiefly have a layer that impedes downward movement of water or have moderately fine to fine texture. They have a slow rate of water transmission.
4;High runoff potential;The soils have a very slow infiltration rate when thoroughly wetted. They chiefly consist of clay soils that have a high swelling potential soils that have a permanent water table soils that have a claypan or clay layer at or near the surface and shallow soils over nearly impervious material. They have a very slow rate of water transmission.
