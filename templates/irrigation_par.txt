# Qadaq: irrigation water depth [mm]

# K_stress: water stress coefficient for the activation of irrigation from water diversions
K_stress = [%KSTRESS%]

# K_stresspozzi: water stress coefficient for the activation of irrigation from private wells
K_stresswells = [%KSTRESSWELL%]

# fw: exposed and wetted soil fraction

# Min_a & Max_a: parameters of percolation model

# Min_b & Max_b: parameters of percolation model
Min_b = [%BMIN%]

# a, b, c: parameters of irrigation losses model
# Irrigation losses model is described by the equation:
# Irrigation_losses = a + b * wind_speed + c * average_temperature
# If irrigation losses do not depend from wind speed or average temperature, set:
# a = fixed irrigation loss (expressed as a percentage between 0 & 100); b = 0; c = 0
a = [%ALOSSES%]
b = [%BLOSSES%]
c = [%CLOSSES%]

# InterceptionFlag: irrigation water is intercepted by foliage?
# InterceptionFlag = TRUE or T if irrigation water is interception by foliage
# InterceptionFlag = FALSE or F if irrigation water is not interception by foliage
InterceptionFlag = [%FINTERCEPTION%]

# Irrigation run time
